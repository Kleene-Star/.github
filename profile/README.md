# KleeneStar - Modular Knowledge, Open Collaboration

**KleeneStar** is a private, non-commercial open-source initiative for structured management of knowledge, processes, and digital assets.

Built on the [WebExpress-Framework](https://github.com/webexpress-framework), **KleeneStar** offers a plugin-based architecture that empowers organizations and individuals to create distributed, privacy-conscious applications with full control over infrastructure.

## What We Stand For

**KleeneStar** reimagines digital collaboration - a plugin-based architecture for managing knowledge, processes, and assets with clarity and autonomy. It grows with your ideas, from local setups to distributed networks.

- **Modularity by Design**: Every feature is a plugin. Combine freely, extend easily.
- **On-Premises First**: Your data, your infrastructure, your rules.
- **Legal Transparency**: GDPR-compliant, with multilingual documentation and role-based access control.
- **No Commercial Interests**: No paywalls, no hidden licenses, no monetization. Just meaningful collaboration.

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions in many areas:

- **C# Backend:** Plugin development, event system, API design  
- **Frontend (JS/TS):** UI components, responsive design, accessibility  
- **Testing:** Manual and automated tests, bug reports  
- **Design:** Icons, diagrams, UI assets  
- **Documentation:** Architecture texts, translations, tutorials  
- **Community:** Moderating discussions, onboarding, feedback

Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or curious mind: your input matters.
