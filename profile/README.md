# KleeneStar - Modular Knowledge, Open Collaboration

**KleeneStar** is a private, non-commercial open-source initiative for structured management of knowledge, processes, and digital assets.

Built on the `WebExpress` framework, **KleeneStar** offers a plugin-based architecture that empowers organizations and individuals to create distributed, privacy-conscious applications with full control over infrastructure.

## What We Stand For

- **Modularity by Design** - Every feature is a plugin. Combine freely, extend easily.
- **On-Premises First** - Your data, your infrastructure, your rules.
- **Legal Transparency** - GDPR-compliant, with multilingual documentation and role-based access control.
- **No Commercial Interests** - No paywalls, no hidden licenses, no monetization. Just meaningful collaboration.

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions in many areas:

- `C# Backend:` Plugin development, event system, API design  
- `Frontend (JS/TS):` UI components, responsive design, accessibility  
- `Testing:` Manual and automated tests, bug reports  
- `Design:` Icons, diagrams, UI assets  
- `Documentation:` Architecture texts, translations, tutorials  
- `Community:` Moderating discussions, onboarding, feedback

Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or curious mind: your input matters.
