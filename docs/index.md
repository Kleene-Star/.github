## KleeneStar Platform

Modular architecture for knowledge, process, and asset management – built with **KleeneStar**.

**KleeneStar** is an integrated, web-based platform for structured management of knowledge, tasks, and digital assets. Built on the [WebExpress framework](https://github.com/webexpress-framework), it offers a highly extensible architecture for organizations that value data sovereignty, operational efficiency, and technical clarity. Its goal is to replace fragmented system landscapes with a unified, modular solution and to sustainably improve digital collaboration.

## Objectives

**KleeneStar** was designed to overcome the typical weaknesses of isolated single-purpose tools. Many organizations rely on separate systems for documentation, task tracking, and file management—resulting in high costs, redundant data, and poor integration. **KleeneStar** addresses these issues with five core objectives:

- **Eliminate system fragmentation:** All essential functions are unified in a single interface. Users no longer need to switch between tools.
- **Boost productivity:** A consistent, cross-module search enables fast access to all relevant information. Data remains consistent and up to date.
- **Ensure extensibility:** The platform is built on a plugin architecture that supports custom extensions—even from third-party developers.
- **Guarantee data sovereignty:** On-premises deployment ensures full control over all data—especially critical in sensitive environments.
- **Reduce costs:** By consolidating multiple systems and using a permissive MIT license, licensing, maintenance, and operational costs are significantly lowered.

## Benefits for Users

**KleeneStar** is not only technically sound—it delivers tangible benefits in daily work:

- **Unified interface:** All content (tasks, articles, files) is accessible from a single UI, reducing onboarding time and increasing user acceptance.
- **Cross-module search:** With WebExpress Query Language (WQL) and the IndexManager, complex queries across modules are fast, precise, and traceable.
- **Linked content:** Tasks can be directly connected to relevant knowledge articles and digital assets, creating a coherent information flow without manual linking.
- **Secure and transparent:** Rights and roles are centrally managed via the IdentityManager. LDAP integration enables seamless connection to existing identity services.
- **Flexibly extensible:** New modules can be added via plugins. The platform grows with your needs—without disrupting the user experience.

## Core Modules

The platform is composed of several core modules, each implemented as standalone plugins within the [WebExpress-Framework](https://github.com/webexpress-framework) ecosystem. Every module serves a clearly defined purpose and is deeply integrated into the overall architecture:

- **Knowledge Management:** Enables structured creation, editing, and versioning of articles. Hierarchical organization, commenting, and granular permissions ensure clarity and control.
- **Process Management:** Tasks, work packages, and issue reports can be captured, assigned, and tracked. Configurable workflows support diverse process models.
- **Asset Management:** Digital content such as documents, images, videos, or code libraries is centrally stored, versioned, and categorized. A preview function simplifies review.
- **Customer Portal:** External users can access shared content via a dedicated portal. Visibility is controlled with fine-grained permissions—secure and transparent.

## Roadmap

**KleeneStar’s** development follows clearly defined phases, balancing short-term deliverables with long-term innovation:

| Phase      | Focus Modules                    | Key Technologies             | Target Impact
