## Abstract

This section outlines the architectural foundations and design principles behind **KleeneStar**. It provides context for how modularity, extensibility, and clarity are achieved across the platform.

## Overview

**KleeneStar** is built on the `WebExpress` framework, which emphasizes plugin-based modularity, event-driven communication, and clean separation of concerns. The conceptual layer defines how core ideas translate into technical structures and user-facing functionality.

## Included Topics

- [Requirements](requirement.md): Understand the functional and non-functional goals that shaped **KleeneStar’s** architecture and design decisions.
- [Core Data Model](cdm.md): Learn how entities, relationships, and metadata are structured to support knowledge, task, and asset management.

## Purpose

The Concept section is intended for developers, architects, and contributors who want to understand the "why" behind **KleeneStar’s** design. It connects high-level goals with concrete implementation strategies and serves as a reference point for future module development.
