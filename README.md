# KleeneStar – Open-source platform for structured management of knowledge, processes, and digital assets

**KleeneStar** is an open-source initiative for modular, web-based platforms designed to manage knowledge, processes, and digital assets in a structured way.

## What We’re Building

Creating a distributed application for organizing knowledge, tasks, and assets. KleeneStar is built on the WebExpress framework and offers:

- **Modular Architecture:** All features are implemented as plugins and can be freely combined.
- **On-Premises Operation:** Full control over data and infrastructure.
- **Extensibility:** New modules can be easily integrated—even by third parties.
- **Legal Compliance:** Legal notice, data protection, and role management are integral components.

## No Commercial Interests

**KleeneStar** pursues no commercial goals. There are no hidden license models, no paywalls, no profit motives. 
All contributions are voluntary and unpaid. What we offer is a space for meaningful collaboration, professional learning, and long-term impact.

- **C# Backend:** Plugin development, event system, API design
- **Frontend (JS/TS):** UI components, responsive design, accessibility
- **Testing:** Manual and automated tests, bug reports
- **Design:** Icons, diagrams, UI assets
